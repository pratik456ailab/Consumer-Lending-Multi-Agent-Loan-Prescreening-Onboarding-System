# Consumer-Lending-Multi-Agent-Loan-Prescreening-Onboarding-System
Created an AI-driven multi-agent pipeline for customer onboarding and loan prescreening. Implemented 4 independent agents to collect customer details, detect loan preferences, and provide document checklists based on loan type. Used Autogen for agent-to-agent communication, JSON summarization, and automated task flow.
